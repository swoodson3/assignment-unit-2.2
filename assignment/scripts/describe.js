// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// Variable is named Dane.
// If name equals Mary console log would read Hi, Mary!
// Name does not equal Mary, so the else function would be run.
//Console log would then read How do you do? This should be what it should read.  

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// Two Varibles secret and code. If code equals 123 secret would equal super.
// Code does equal 123 so console log would output super.
// Second if says, if code is greater than 250 secret would be duper.
// Code is not greater than 250 so the 1st if statement would run. 

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// If isStudent is equal to true and zip is greater than 80000 than console log would run, Your a student on the West Coast.
// Else if isStudent  equals false or age less than 30, console log would run What are your hobbies.
// Else if isStudent equals true, console log would run Welcome to Prime! (Which is the correct output)
//Else if none of them are correct console log would default to How about the weather. 

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);

  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');

  console.log('How about the weather?')

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/

// Since colorOne blue and colorTwo red, plus mix is true than both shoulde be set to purple. 
//Only colorOne is set to purple and not colorTwo. colorTwo should also be set to purple.
//Plus they will need to console.log it as well. 

//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';

// The issue with this one is "||"" is "or". In the description it says and. 
//It should be changed to &&.

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

//Since age is greater or equal to minAge console log should run "Enter".
//It does not beause if's console log is set to "no entry".
//If and else's console logs need to be switched for it to run the correct console log of "enter".

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
